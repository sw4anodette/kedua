    <h1>Macaron by Sabrina</h1>
    <p>Macaron, sweet, small, round French sandwich cookie made from meringue, almond flour, sugar, and food colouring and adorned with a variety of fillings including buttercream, chocolate ganache, marzipan, jam, and fruit compote. The macaron should not be confused with the macaroon, although both names originate from the Latin word maccare (meaning “to crush” into a fine consistency) and both cookies share some ingredients. Whereas macarons are of uniform size and many colours, macaroons (spoon-drop cookies customarily made with shredded coconut) are golden brown, irregular in size and shape, and much easier to make.</p>
